        {id:3, title:'The Digital Scroll: Jack Kerouac’s On the Road Manuscript', img:"jack.jpg", tech:['Touchscreen','Javascript','Leaflet'], url:"http://showcase.avl.iu.edu/on-the-road/", desc:"<p>The Advanced Visualization Lab collaborated with the Lilly Library to create a digital interface to Jack Kerouac’s original On the Road manuscript.</p></br> <p>The Digital Scroll was displayed alongside the original scroll at the Lilly Library, in conjunction with the Lilly’s exhibition celebrating the 100th birthday of William S. Burroughs. The Digital Scroll allows curators to highlight passages describing “Old Bull Lee,” a character based on Burroughs. The AVL’s use of open tools creates opportunities to reuse this software for future digitization efforts and the display of very large images and maps.</p></br> <p>To avoid pausing to feed his typewriter new sheets of paper, Jack Kerouac wrote his novel On the Road on one 120-foot-long scroll of tracing paper sheets that he had taped together. This scroll has since been digitized in order to allow exploring the manuscript without exposing the fragile document to excessive handling. AVL staff created an interface to the digital version of the manuscript using open-source web technologies and a multi-touch display. Users can explore the document using intuitive multi-touch gestures, and view a selection of important passages using an on-screen navigation menu.</p></br><p>The scroll has been blurred out to protect copywrite.</p> <br><br><i> Scroll blurred for copyright</i> "},

It will remain in the lab to educate visitors about the Glenn Black Lab, the Angel Mounds site, and the Mississippian culture.  <br><br><i> This project runs on a large touch screen table. Some functionality and design translates incorrectly on a normal web browser.</i> "},

It included a curated list of IU datasets, and allowed users to rotate the sphere by dragging the 3D model in the middle."},
        {id:11, title:'Conglomerate Distortions', img:"conglomerate.jpg", tech:['X3D'], url:"http://www.peterjwilliams.com/ConglomerateDistortions/", desc:"<p>The AVL consulted with Peter Williams on how to best bring in his artwork into a 3D environment. A stereoscopic version was created for the exhibition that utilized the Wells Library IQ-Wall.</p></br> <p><strong>Technical Description:</strong></p></br><p> Five completed Conglomerate Distortions were composed using X3D. In each, individual image layers were UV mapped onto individual spheres. The spheres were created at slightly different sizes and animated in rotation at slightly different speeds. Since the UV maps are visible on both sides of a sphere’s surface, a virtual camera can be positioned inside or outside, giving different viewing relationships. The virtual camera cycles between ten X3D viewpoints.</p>"},
